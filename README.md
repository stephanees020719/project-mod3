## Introduction:
This is my final project for Per Scholas. It's an  application that allows users to create, edit, delete and view characters from the Dragon Ball Z series. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their characters. 

## Technologies-Used:
Node.js, 
Express.js,
MongoDB/mongoose,
React Vite,
JWT for authentication,
Bcrypt for passwork hashing,
HTML/CSS.


## Getting-Started:
You can start the server by running npm run dev


## Future-Enhancements:
User profiles: Allowing users to add more information about themselves.
Character images: Allowing users to upload or select character images for their profile.
Search and filter: Implementing search and filter options to find characters easily.
Social features: Adding the ability to share characters or follow other users.


## Unsolved Problems:
Testing: Writing tests for my server and client code to ensure reliability.
